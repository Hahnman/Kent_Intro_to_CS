            <p>
                In 1973, our founder Billy Bob Doe, broke down in his Oldsmobile on the
                border of a little town in Maine. After hours of trying to contact anyone
                he had a grand idea. In the small town he stopped in, he decided to set up shop.
                Later that day he used all his drug money and bought a loaf of bread, ham, lettuce,
                and other assorted condiments and opened up a small lemonade-stand-style sandwich place.
                His revolutionary sandwich recipe earned him major profits in the first day and
                a few months later, opened up a small shop that has now expanded into one of
                the largest chains around!"
                <br>
                Known all over the world for his revolutionary recipe, BillyBob's has become
                a front-runner in the sandwich industry and our only care is customer satisfaction.
                Where other chains fail to realize the value of their customers, we see you as much
                more, friends and family. Our sandwiches artists are always happy to make delicacies
                between two pieces of bread and many stores have custom items to choose from. So, if
                you want a good sandwich for a great price, stop in or order delivery today!
